#scraper
#scraper creates new coin objects from what it finds on CoinMarketCap.
#get_list reveals a list of coin objects in numbered order. It says, "Okay, scraper, you have all 100. I only want 11-20."
#Then more_info should reveal more information about one of those coins created earlier. Still pulling from the same scraped list of 100. I think.


#Need to fix a hole in the CommandLine where an invalid input breaks the secondary_request loop.
#Want to add search_by_name functionality. I want the user to be able to pull #more_info about a coin based on its name, not just rank.
#Would also be nice to be able to search by price. Not sure if current design would allow that, but I think it would.
# - "There's a coin for every budget. How much money would you like to spend?" // Cryptocurrency suggestions by price.
# - "Oh, you have ten dollars? Here's a coin you can afford!"
