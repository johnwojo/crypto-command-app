## Usage

#TODO:

- In order to use the file, type 'bin/run' into the terminal.
- Once you've been welcomed, the program will prompt you to enter a number.
- The user will enter 1 for 1-10, 11 for 11-20, 21 for 21-30, etc.
- After that initial request is made, the user will have the option to make a second request.
- If the user types 'list,' they will be prompted to repeat the initial request and a list will be provided.
- If the user types 'info,' they will be asked to enter a number corresponding with a coin that they'd like more info on.
- If the user types 'exit,' the program will end.
